## What are we doing ?

<li> We work on optimal parameter research for machine learning models </li>
<li> We test the machine learning models to prepare a report </li>
<li> We stock our data that we obtain and we use those for future works </li>

## How we are doing ?

<li> Firstly , we plan our working steps and we decide our assingments. </li>
<li> Secondly , we work on our assigments and we analyze the results of our works </li>
<li> Finally , we prepare a report about our intuition that we obtain in those works <li>
